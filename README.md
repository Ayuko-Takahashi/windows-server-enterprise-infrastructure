# Enterprise Windows Server Infrastructure Case Study

This repository presents a comprehensive case study demonstrating hands-on experience with enterprise Windows Server administration, security enforcement, virtualization, and infrastructure services. The project simulates real-world on-premises system administration tasks commonly performed in enterprise environments.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The objective of this case study was to design, deploy, secure, and manage a multi-server Windows Server infrastructure supporting a multi-site organization. The work focuses on practical implementation of enterprise services rather than theoretical exercises.

## 🧩 Scope of Work
The case study covers the following areas:

- Active Directory Domain Services deployment using Server Core  
- Group Policy configuration and security enforcement  
- DHCP configuration with multiple scopes, superscope, multicast scope, and reservations  
- DNS configuration with external forwarding  
- Storage pool and virtual disk creation  
- iSCSI shared storage configuration between servers  
- Hyper-V deployment and virtual machine creation  
- Hyper-V Replica configuration for high availability  
- WSUS installation and centralized update management  
- Windows Deployment Services (WDS) configuration  
- Client update and deployment enforcement using Group Policy  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Windows Server (Server Core and GUI)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Group Policy Management
- DHCP & DNS
- Storage Spaces & iSCSI
- Hyper-V & Hyper-V Replica
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
